# About
This project requires implementing multiple ADTs and sorting methods, with the end goal of implementing a word-frequency dictionary which can take a text file as an input and output the total counts of each unique word in the file.

## ADTs and algorithms
This project requires implementation of the following items:
* Array-based Stack (imported from Project 1)
* String Comparator
* AVL Tree
* MoveToFrontList (LinkedList variationin which new items are inserted at the front of the list, and an existing item gets moved to the front whenever it is referenced)
* HashTable
* String Hasher
* topKSort
* heapSort
* FourHeap (subclass of Heap with four children)

## Testing
This project also requires testing each element via JUnit. Unit test samples are provided, but each implemented ADT and sort must have corresponding JUnit test suites.
